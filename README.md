Project Description: HR Analytics Dashboard for Employee Attribution and Attrition Analysis

This project involved leveraging a comprehensive dataset containing detailed information about employees from various companies. 
The goal was to develop an HR analytics dashboard using Power BI, providing insights into employee attribution and attrition rates.

The dashboard showcases key metrics such as employee attribution, attribution rates, and attrition rates based on different criteria including gender, department, age, salary, and education. 
By visually representing this data, the dashboard enables HR professionals and decision-makers to gain a deeper understanding of the workforce composition and identify patterns and trends that contribute to employee attrition.

Furthermore, the dashboard provides valuable information on the average age of employees, attrition rates based on years spent in the company, and the total number of employees in each company. 
These insights facilitate strategic workforce planning, talent management, and decision-making processes within the organization.

The development of the HR analytics dashboard demonstrates strong data analysis and visualization skills, as well as proficiency in utilizing Power BI to transform complex data into actionable insights. 
By showcasing this project in your CV, you highlight your ability to leverage HR analytics to drive informed decision-making and optimize employee retention strategies within organizations.
